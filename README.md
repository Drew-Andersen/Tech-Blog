## Description
This is a full stack application that was developed so that users could come create and interact with content regarding tech. The application gives users a space to store created content via a dashboard page, comment on other users posts, as well as edit and delete their own posts and comments. 

## Installation
In order for this application to work the user will need to clone down the repository to their local machine. In VS Code the user will need to open an integrated terminal on the ./db/schema.sql file. In the termainal the user will need to type in 'psql -U postgres' and then put their password in the termainal when prompted. Once in the PostgreSQL system the user will need to create the database by typing in '\i schema.sql' into the integrated terminal. Once that is done the user will need to open another integrated terminal on the server.js file. Once the new terminal is opened, the user will be able to type in 'npm run seed'. This will fill out the data tables that were created. Then the user can type 'npm start' to start the application on localhost.

## Usage
Usage of this application is intuitive. Users will interact with the site completely through the frontend UI. They will see a public facing feed, and a login button where they will be prompted to either login or sign up. From the navigation the entire application can be conducted, and users can contribute and start creating content instantly.
